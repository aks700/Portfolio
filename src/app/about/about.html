                   My name is Akshat Goel, and I find joy in transforming ideas into <span class="default-highlight">software that makes a real impact.</span>
                </p>

                    My journey into technology has been fueled by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving. I see development not just as writing code but as a way of shaping solutions that improve systems, connect people, and bring innovation to life.

                <p class="default-p">
                    Over the years, I`ve had the opportunity to work on projects and internships that deeply strengthened my trust in development. <span class="default-highlight">At Aaizel Int. Technologies </span>, I explored the intersection of AI and software engineering by developing a <span class="default-highlight">Conditional GAN for temperature imputation </span>, optimizing models for real-world performance, and deploying scalable solutions with Docker and AWS. At <span class="default-highlight">Jio Platforms </span>, I worked on a high-precision<span class="default-highlight"> real-time timer system in C/C++ that managed schedules for 100,000+ streetlights</span>, teaching me how critical performance, reliability, and collaboration are in large-scale systems.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    Beyond internships, I`ve also built projects ranging from a <span class="default-highlight">video streaming backend with secure JWT authentication </span>to a rule-based beverage bot powered by machine learning. Each challenge reinforced my excitement for software craftsmanship â€” whether architecting APIs, designing system logic, or streamlining deployments.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                   What drives me most is the process of <span class="default-highlight">continuous learning and experimentation</span>. I love debugging complex problems, diving into documentation, and pushing myself to master new frameworks and tools. From backend development to machine learning pipelines,<span class="default-highlight"> I embrace every opportunity to explore, refine, and grow as a developer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                   Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball, listening to music, exploring new tech trends, solving coding challenges, and unwinding with movies or outdoor activities. These hobbies keep me active, creative, and balanced.
